# Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Sea-Ice-extent-using-Statistical-and-Deep-Learning-Approach

Southern Hemisphere ice census is vital for ocean operations and ship safety. Using Recurrent Neural Networks and logistic growth, we predict ice flow from NSIDC data (1978-2019). Our models achieve RMSE of 0.58 (RNN) and 0.71 (logistic growth) for ice extent movement predictions.
